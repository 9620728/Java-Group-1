# Java-Group-1
## Alien Chess
Our group is going to create a chess game with an alien twist. All of the pieces will be alien themed, and some of the pieces will have special moves or "powers". The game will have a graphics approach, with the user dropping and dragging the chess pieces to the allowed spots. 

### Roles

Pax - Graphics, Alec - Testing, Nate - UX/UI, Oliver - Developer, Kainoa - Developer
